⚠ **PLEASE READ** ⚠: Due to prioritising finishing the client for desktop first we are not accepting reports related to mobile platforms for the time being, unless you're willing to fix them.
If you'd like to report a problem or suggest a feature and then work on it, feel free to open an issue and highlight that you'd like to address it yourself in the issue body; mobile pull requests are also welcome.
Otherwise, please check back in the future when the focus of development shifts towards mobile!
