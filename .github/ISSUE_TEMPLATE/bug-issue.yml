        ## Logs

        Attaching log files is required for **every** issue, regardless of whether you deem them required or not. See instructions below on how to find them.

        ### Desktop platforms

        If the game has not yet been closed since you found the bug:
          1. Head on to game settings and click on "Export logs"
          2. Click the notification to locate the file
          3. Drag the generated `.zip` files into the github issue window

        ### Mobile platforms

        The places to find the logs on mobile platforms are as follows:
          - *On Android*, navigate to `Android/data/sh.ppy.osulazer/files/logs` using a file browser app.
          - *On iOS*, connect your device to a PC and copy the `logs` directory from the app's document storage using iTunes. (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301#copy-to-computer)
