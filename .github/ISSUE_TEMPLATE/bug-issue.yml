        ## Logs

        Attaching log files is required for every reported bug. See instructions below on how to find them.

        If the game has not yet been closed since you found the bug:
          1. Head on to game settings and click on "Open osu! folder"
          2. Then open the `logs` folder located there

        **Logs are reset when you reopen the game.** If the game crashed or has been closed since you found the bug, retrieve the logs using the file explorer instead.

        The default places to find the logs are as follows:
          - `%AppData%/osu/logs` *on Windows*
          - `~/.local/share/osu/logs` *on Linux & macOS*
          - `Android/data/sh.ppy.osulazer/files/logs` *on Android*
          - *On iOS*, they can be obtained by connecting your device to your desktop and copying the `logs` directory from the app's own document storage using iTunes. (https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201301#copy-to-computer)

        If you have selected a custom location for the game files, you can find the `logs` folder there.

        After locating the `logs` folder, select all log files inside and drag them into the "Logs" box below.
