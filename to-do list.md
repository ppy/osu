top-level overview of what is left to be completed for the new osu!client. Still a WIP, which means there's stuff to add which hasn't been added, but also potentially out-of-date items which need to be updated.

ile this issue will exist for now, I plan on exploding each of these tasks into individual issues, so we can tackle (and discuss) them in a more optimal manner.
