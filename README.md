Rhythm is just a *click* away. The future of osu! and the beginning of an open era!

# Status

This is still heavily under development and is not intended for end-user use. This repository is intended for developer collaboration. You're welcome to try and use it but please do not submit bug reports without a patch. Please do not ask for help building or using this software.

# Requirements

- A desktop platform which can compile .NET 4.5.
- Visual Studio or MonoDevelop is recommended.

# Contributing

We welcome all contributions, but keep in mind that we already have a lot of the UI designed. If you wish to work on something with the intention on having it included in the official distribution, please open an issue for discussion and we will give you what you need from a design perspective to proceed. If you want to make *changes* to the design, we recommend you open an issue with your intentions before spending too much time, to ensure no effort is wasted.

Contributions can be made via pull requests to this repository. We hope to credit and reward larger contributions via a [bounty system](https://goo.gl/nFdoyI). If you're unsure of what you can help with, check out the [list](https://github.com/ppy/osu/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abounty) of available issues with bounty.

Note that while we already have certain standards in place, nothing is set in stone. If you have an issue with the way code is structured; with any libraries we are using; with any processes involved with contributing, *please* bring it up. I welcome all feedback so we can make contributing to this project as pain-free as possible.
