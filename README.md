Rhythm is just a *click* away. The future of [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh) and the beginning of an open era!

# Status

This is still heavily under development and is not intended for end-user use. This repository is intended for developer collaboration. You're welcome to try and use it but please do not submit bug reports without a patch. Please do not ask for help building or using this software.

# Requirements

- A desktop platform that can compile .NET 4.6.1. We recommend using [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/) (Windows), [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/) (macOS) or [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/download/) (Linux), all of which are free. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) may also be used but requires further setup steps which are not covered here.

# Getting Started
- Clone the repository including submodules (`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ppy/osu`)
- Build in your IDE of choice (recommended IDEs automatically restore nuget packages; if you are using an alternative make sure to `nuget restore`)

# Contributing

We welcome all contributions, but keep in mind that we already have a lot of the UI designed. If you wish to work on something with the intention on having it included in the official distribution, please open an issue for discussion and we will give you what you need from a design perspective to proceed. If you want to make *changes* to the design, we recommend you open an issue with your intentions before spending too much time, to ensure no effort is wasted.

Please make sure you are familiar with the [development and testing](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/wiki/Development-and-Testing) procedure we have set up. New component development, and where possible, bug fixing and debugging existing components **should always be done under VisualTests**.

Contributions can be made via pull requests to this repository. We hope to credit and reward larger contributions via a [bounty system](https://www.bountysource.com/teams/ppy). If you're unsure of what you can help with, check out the [list of open issues](https://github.com/ppy/osu/issues).

Note that while we already have certain standards in place, nothing is set in stone. If you have an issue with the way code is structured; with any libraries we are using; with any processes involved with contributing, *please* bring it up. I welcome all feedback so we can make contributing to this project as pain-free as possible.
